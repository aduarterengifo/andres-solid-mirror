Andres-solid-mirror. 

Mirrors andres-solid project inside ts-mono plus some teaks so it compiles.

- m-n-k game.
- uses convolutions to check winning conditions. 
    - extremely not optimal from a performance pov.
- also includes a infinite-grid implementation inspired (derived) from https://public.work.

# to run 

- bun i 
- bun dev 
- goto: localhost:3003/m-n-k

# uses:

solid  and 
solid-router,
tailwind for styling. 

hopefully this is sufficiently not a framework.
